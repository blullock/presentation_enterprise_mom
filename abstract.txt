What the Enterprise Could Learn from your Mom

We have been living in the shadow of Moore's law for many years. Transistor sizes keep shrinking and processor speeds keep increasing. But technology seems to have hit a brick wall. Clock cycles have not been able to keep up with the shrinking transistor. As a result, manufacturers have increased performance by putting more CPUs on a chip. But is today's software really able to deal with the concurrency demands of today's hardware? How will tomorrow's enterprise software have to change to take real advantage of this new push toward multi-core machines. This talk will take a look at current and future trends in software concurrency with respect to Ruby and other Languages.
